# HTML music album Template

You may use the template as is. You only need to change your Cover-Image and the audio tracks.
All HTML content needs to be minted in a zip file. You can have multiple files inside your zip, however there are a few requirements you can't miss.

1. Ensure to have no folder hierarchy. Put every file in the same folder than index.html.
2. Name your Cover Image "Cover.jpg". Make it 768 x 768 px. It will be used as thumbnail image as well.
3. Edit index.html - Change filename and displayed Title. Add as many tracks as you need:  <li audiourl="Filename_of_Song1.mp3">Displayed Title of Song 1</li>
4. Maximum filesize of the ZIP is 40 MB

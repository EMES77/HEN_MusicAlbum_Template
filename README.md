All HTML content needs to be minted in a zip file. You can have multiple files inside your zip, however there are a few requirements you can't miss.

1. Ensure to have no folder hierarchy. Put every file in the same folder than index.html.
2. Name your Cover Image "Cover.jpg". Make it 768 x 768 px. It will be used as thumbnail image as well.
3. If you want a video to play as Cover, put an mp4 with the name "BG.mp4" in the folder.
4. Edit index.html - Change filename and displayed titles of your audio files. Add as many tracks as you need:  <li audiourl="Filename_of_Song1.mp3">Displayed Title of Song 1</li>
5. The maximum filesize of the ZIP must be under 40 MB. In our experience that is appr. 25-30 minutes of mp3 in 192 kBit. If you put in a video as Cover it might be less.
